                    <h4>Abandoned Matches/Retirements:</h4>
                    <p>If one player withdraws or is disqualified after the first set has been completed, the player
                      progressing to the next round or that is awarded the match by the umpire will be considered the
                      winner. If the first set has not been completed, all Match Bets will be void. If a match does not
                      reach a natural conclusion, any markets (besides Match Betting) that are not unconditionally
                      determined will be void. For the avoidance of doubt, all bets on the 'Set Betting' will be made
                      void if there is a retirement. </p>
                    <h4>Postponed/Rearranged Matches:</h4>
                    <p>In the event of the following circumstances taking place, all bets will stand:</p>
                    <ul class="faq-list-disc">
                      <li>A change of playing surface</li>
                      <li> A change of venue</li>
                      <li> A change from indoor court to outdoor court or vice versa</li>
                      <li> A match being played or continuing into a subsequent day</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Match Prices:</h4>
                    <p>Winning bets must predict the winner of the match. In the event of a match being awarded to a
                      player for whatever reason before the full number of sets have been played, but at least one set
                      has been completed, all bets will stand on the player officially going through to the next round
                      or declared as the winner of the tournament. In the event of a change in the official total number
                      of sets played in a match, all bets will stand.</p>
                    <h4> Game Handicap Prices:</h4>
                    <p> Winning bets must predict the player who wins the most number of games after their total has
                      been adjusted by the handicap. In the event that there is no outright winner after the adjustment
                      of the handicap, all bets will be void.</p>
                    <h4>Total Game Prices:</h4>
                    <p>Winning bets must predict the winner of the game. If a game is not completed for whatever reason,
                      bets will be settled based on the player who is awarded the game. decisions in respect of the
                      settlement of bets on Game Prices will be final.</p>
                    <h4> Handicap Prices:</h4>
                    <p> Winning bets must predict the player who serves the most number of aces after the total has been
                      adjusted by the handicap. In the event that there is no outright winner after the adjustment of
                      the handicap, all bets will be void</p>
                    <h4> Set Prices:</h4>
                    <p>Winning bets must predict the exact score between the players. The full number of sets required
                      to win the match must be achieved for set betting bets to stand, otherwise bets will be void. In
                      the event of a change in the official total number of sets played in the match, all bets will be
                      void.</p>
                    <h4>Game Prices:</h4>
                    <p> Winning bets must predict the winner of the game. If a game is not completed for whatever
                      reason, bets will be settled based on the player who is awarded the game. Decisions in respect of
                      the settlement of bets on Game Prices will be final.</p>
                    <h4> Number of Games in a Set/Correct Score:</h4>
                    <p>Winning bets predict the number of games in a given set or the margin of victory in a set. If the
                      set is not completed for whatever reason, all bets for that set will be void. If the match is
                      abandoned after the completion of the set all bets for the previous set will stand. A tie break is
                      considered as one game for settlement purposes.</p>
                    <h4> Double Faults in Game:</h4>
                    <p> Winning bets must predict the number of double faults in the relevant game. If a match is
                      abandoned for any reason, bets will be void unless the bet has already been settled. Flooks will
                      look at all available evidence to determine the result of these bets in order to make a fair
                      determination of whether the service was in fact an double fault. Our decision in respect of such
                      bets shall be final and we reserve the right to void such bets where it is impossible to
                      conclusively determine whether a serve was an ace/double fault based on all available evidence at
                      the time.</p>
                    <h4> Points/Receiver Points in Game:</h4>
                    <p> Winning bets must predict the number of points played in the relevant game. If a match is
                      abandoned for any reason, bets will be void unless the bet has already been settled. Code
                      violation points counts towards the total number of points in a game.</p>
                    <h4>Point Winner:</h4>
                    <p> Winning bets must predict the winner of each point in a game. Bets placed on the winner of
                      points that do not take place will be void. Where a player is handed a code violation by the
                      umpire and a point is awarded to their opponent, bets placed on the winner of the next point will
                      be void. </p>
                    <p>For example, after the 3rd point in the first game of a match Murray is handed a code violation
                      and a point is awarded to Federer. In this case all bets on the 4th Point, 1st Game will be void.
                      However, we will count a code violation point in order to settle the total number of points in
                      game. If a point is mistakenly settled before a player 'challenges' the outcome of the point in
                      matches where such actions are allowed, we reserve the right to resettle the bet and make positive
                      or negative adjustments to your account depending on the outcome of the challenge.</p>
                    <h4> To win a specific Set (Set Winner):</h4>
                    <p> Predict the winner of a specific set the set must be completed for bets to stand </p>
                    <h4>Game Correct Score in a specific set:</h4>
                    <p> Predict the correct score in a specific game in a specific set The game must be completed for
                      bets to stand. </p>
                    <h4>Tournament Prices:</h4>
                    <p>Winning bets must predict the total number of occurrences in a certain event (e.g. the total
                      number of aces). If a tournament is postponed or cancelled, or the length of the tournament is
                      reduced, all bets will be void. </p>
                    <h4>Method of point won:</h4>
                    <ul class="faq-list-disc">
                      <li>Serve - Any point that ends with the receiver failing to return the ball successfully back
                        into play.</li>
                      <li>Double Fault - A point won by the receiver where the server fails to get either their 1st or
                        2nd serves into play.</li>
                      <li>Backhand Winner - A point won by a backhand ground stroke that bounces twice before an
                        opponent makes contact with it.</li>

                        must bounce twice before an opponent makes contact with it.</li>
                      <li>Error - Any point won when a player makes contact with a shot whilst the ball is in play, but
                        fails to return the ball successfully back into play. Any return of serve is governed by the
                        Serve rule.</li>
                      <li> Next Point - Total Shots: Winning bets must predict the total number of shots played in the
                        point. </li>
                      <li> A shot is only counted if the ball lands back in play. (Double Fault=0 ; Ace/Serve Winner = 1
                        ...) </li>

                    <h4>General rules:</h4>
                    <p>Should a contest be postponed, bets will stand for 48 hours, inclusive of the original date for
                      the contest. Stakes may be refunded before the original contest if requested. In the event of a
                      'no contest' being declared all bets will be made void. Should there be a substitution for one of
                      the boxers, bets on the original contest will be void. Unless we specifically quote for a draw,
                      boxing bets are on the basis of 'draw = no bet'. Should there be a change in the advertised
                      contest, e.g. a contest changes from a title fight to a non-title fight, bets will stand.</p>
                    <h4> Round betting (or group round betting):</h4>
                    <p> Which round the fight will be won in? Where a boxer fails to answer the bell for the next round,
                      his opponent shall be deemed to have won the contest in the previous round. Should for any reason
                      the scheduled number of rounds be changed before the commencement of the contest, all round by
                      round bets will be void. Where a contest finishes before the completion of the schedule number of
                      rounds and the winner is decided by the judges' scorecards (technical decision/technical draw)
                      then all round bets will be deemed losers. If the contest goes to the scorecards then all round
                      bets will be deemed losers.</p>
                    <h4>Technical decision (TD):</h4>
                    <p>If a fight is scheduled for more than four rounds and an accidental foul occurs causing an injury
                      severe enough for the referee to stop the fight after four rounds have occurred the fight will
                      result in a technical decision or TD awarded to the boxer who is ahead on the score cards at the
                      time the fight is stopped. If an intentional foul causes an injury and the injury results in the
                      fight being stopped in a latter round, the injured boxer will win by technical decision if he is
                      ahead on the score cards. For betting purposes betting on rounds or group of rounds is for a
                      fighter to win by KO, TKO or disqualification during that round or group of rounds. In the event
                      of a technical decision before the end of the fight all bets will be settled as a win by decision.
                      Round bets will be deemed losers.</p>
                    <h4> KO or TKO: </h4>
                    <p> Knockout (KO) is when the boxer does not stand up after a ten count. Technical knockout (TKO) is
                      the three knockdown rule or if the referee steps in when it is decided that a fighter cannot
                      safely continue to fight. If a fighter fails to answer a bell for the next round then this will
                      also be deemed a TKO.</p>
                    <h4>Technical draw:</h4>
                    <p>If an intentional foul causes an injury and the injury results in the fight being stopped in a
                      later round, the fight will result in a 'technical draw' if the injured boxer is behind or even on
                      the score cards. This will result in a draw being deemed the winner for betting purposes.</p>
                    <h4>Method of victory:</h4>
                    <p>Will be deemed to be the official result as officially declared at ringside. For betting purpose,
                      KO/TKO option also includes disqualification (DSQ) and retired (RTD). If a contest ends in a draw
                      all bets on this market will be deemed losers. </p>
                    <h4>Total rounds:</h4>
                    <p>For settlement purposes where half a round is stated then 1 minute 30 seconds of the respective
                      round will define the 'half' to determine under or over. If the number of rounds for a fight is
                      changed after this market has been set then all bets will be void.</p>
                    <h4>To score a knockdown:</h4>
                    <p>For settlement purposes a knockdown is defined as a fighter being KO'd or receiving a mandatory
                      eight count (anything deemed a slip by the referee will not count) Results will be based on the
                      official result at ringside. Results are not official for betting purposes until verified by
                      officials at the fighting venue or by www.boxrec.com Official or unofficial sanctioning body
                      overturns of a fight decision based on appeal, suspension, lawsuit, drug testing result, or any
                      other fighter sanction will not be recognized for betting purposes.</p>
                    <h4>Prize Fighter:</h4>
                    <p>Match bets will be settled on the result announced in the ring. If any result is announced
                      incorrectly at ringside but subsequently corrected then bets will be settled on the correct
                      winner. Outright bets will be settled on the winning boxer who lifts the trophy. If a substitute
                      is introduced during the tournament all outright bets will stand and an oughtright price will be
                      quoted for the new boxer. All outright bets on boxers who withdraw during the tournament due to
                      injury or cuts (having fout on the card) will be deemed losing bets. Outright bets will be void on
                      any boxer who does not start the tournament. A deduction will be applied to all outright bets
                      where a named fighter is withdrawn before the start of the tournament (and an additional contender
                      added).</p>

                    <p> Bets on the next throw in that are not settled at Half Time shall carry over and be settled in
                      the second half up until the end of Normal Time. Bets on the next throw in will be voided at the
                      end of Normal Time if a throw in has not occurred. </p>
                    <p>In Extra Time, a new bet on the next throw in will be offered. Bets on the next throw in that are
                      not settled at the end of the 1st half of extra time shall carry over and be settled in the 2nd
                      half of extra time. Bets on the next throw in will be voided if a golden/silver goal is scored and

                    <p>Bets on the next throw in will be voided at the end of the 2nd half of extra time if a throw in

                    <h4>1st/Next Free Kick, Corner Kick, Goal Kick ('kicks'):</h4>
                    <p> A 'kick' is deemed to have happened when it was awarded.</p>
                    <p> If a 'kick' is awarded to a team but this team is prevented from taking it for whatever reason,
                      this 'kick' has not been awarded and is not counted. Bets on the next 'kick' that are not settled
                      at Half Time shall carry over and be settled in the second half up until the end of Normal Time.
                      Bets on the next 'kick' will be voided at the end of Normal Time if a 'kick' has not occurred.
                    </p>
                    <p>In Extra Time, a new bet on the next 'kick' will be offered. Bets on the next 'kick' that are not
                      settled at the end of the 1st half of extra time shall carry over and be settled in the 2nd half
                      of extra time. Bets on the next 'kick' will be voided if a golden/silver goal is scored and no
                      'kick' has occurred. </p>
                    <p>Bets on the next 'kick' will be voided at the end of the 2nd half of extra time if a 'kick' has
                      not occurred.</p>
                    <h4>1st/Next Yellow Card/Red Card:</h4>
                    <p>Yellow cards or red cards will only count when shown to players up until the end of Normal Time
                      and any shown after the full-time whistle do not count. In the event that two or more players
                      receive a yellow card or red card for being involved in the same incident, the player of the team
                      shown the first card is deemed to have been given the next of first card. </p>
                    <p> Players may receive a maximum of two cards per game. A second yellow card that results in a red
                      card counts only as one card for the purposes of counting the number of cards.</p>
                    <h4>To Score from a Penalty:</h4>
                    <p>In the event that a goalkeeper blocks the penalty and/or it rebounds into play from the post(s)
                      and/or crossbar, and a player scores from the rebound, this is not considered a goal scored from
                      the penalty (even if the goalscorer is the same player as took the penalty kick).</p>
                    <p>The goal is instead considered a goal scored in open play and is recorded as such. If the ball
                      hits the goalpost and/or goalkeeper and crosses the line it is considered a goal.</p>
                    <p> If a penalty is ordered to be re-taken then all bets placed on the markets, the result of the
                      original penalty is void and all bets will stand on the retaken penalty.</p>
                    <p>Penalty not scored 'saved', if Goalkeeper touches the ball directly from the Penalty and goal is
                      not scored direct from the penalty. Penalty not scored 'hit woodwork', if ball directly hits the
                      woodwork from the Penalty and goal is not scored direct from the penalty. Penalty not scored 'miss
                      target' if the ball directly hits neither the woodwork nor the keeper and does not result in a
                      goal direct from the penalty. </p>
                    <h4>Supremacy:</h4>
                    <p>Where a goal supremacy market is offered on a group of matches (e.g. a home goals versus away
                      goals market), if one or more matches are abandoned then all bets on that market will be void.</p>
                    <h4>Outright Betting:</h4>
                    <p>Where there are prices quoted for a team to win a match 'Outright' as well as in '90 Minutes'
                      Play', such as in cup tournaments, all bets will be settled on '90 Minutes' Play' unless the
                      'Outright' price or the 'Qualifying Outright' price has been selected.</p>
                    <h4> Outright Divisional Betting:</h4>
                    <p>In divisional betting, the finishing positions of the teams at the end of the scheduled program
                      of matches will determine the placings with no allowance for play-offs or subsequent enquiries
                      resulting in points deductions by the respective leagues.</p>
                    <p>If any team has points deducted during the season from its total attained on the field of play,
                      the deduction will be included in its final total. However, if any deduction is made after all the
                      games in that division have been completed, it will have no effect on the final total. </p>
                    <h4>Outright Divisional Handicap Betting:</h4>
                    <p>Winning bets must predict the team winning the division based on the application of the handicap.
                    </p>
                    <p>At least one team in each division will start from scratch and all other teams in the division
                      will be awarded a set number of points (or handicap start).</p>
                    <p>Final placings will be determined by adding the points awarded to each team to the total number
                      of points accumulated over the season.</p>
                    <p>Bets must be placed prior to the start of the season and Dead Heat rules apply to teams level on
                      points.</p>
                    <p>Goal difference does not count.</p>

                    <p>Own goals count to the side credited with the goal for settlement purposes. If a goal is scored
                      in injury or stoppage time at the end of the first half, this will be deemed to have been scored
                      in the 45th minute. </p>
                    <p>If a goal is scored in injury or stoppage time, this will be deemed to have been scored in the
                      90th minute. Dead Heat rules apply to this bet. If a match is abandoned after the first goal in a
                      Competition/League has been scored, all bets stand. </p>
                    <p>If any match is abandoned before the first goal in Competition/League has been scored, all bets
                      will be void.</p>

                        and who scores points in the race.</span></p>

                    <p><span>The following is an excerpt from paragraph 6.5 in the F1 Sporting Regulations:</span></p>
                    <p><span>"If a race is suspended under Article 41, and cannot be resumed, no points will be awarded
                        if the leader has completed less than two laps, half points will be awarded if the leader has
                        completed more than two laps but less than 75% of the original race distance and full points
                        will be awarded if the leader has completed more than 75% of the original race distance."</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span></span></p>
                    <p><span>For betting purposes, we shall settle on the official result if two or more laps have been
                        completed. If fewer than two laps are completed, we shall settle any markets which have been
                        unconditionally determined in their entirety. All other markets shall be made void.
                        Unconditionally determined markets are defined as full betting markets or selections about which
                        the result is already fully known. For instance, in Safety Car bets, if the Safety car has
                        already appeared, then all bets on “Yes” and “No” would be settled as the result could not
                        change. If the Safety Car has not appeared at the time, then all bets would be made void.</span>

                    <p><span>A race will be considered to be abandoned based on FIA announcements.</span></p>

                        mid-race) but is concluded before midnight the following day local time, then all bets will

                        titles.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Betting on both the Drivers World Championship and the Constructors World Championship will
