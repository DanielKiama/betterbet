                          the right to cancel the bets along with the payment of the account balance, unless the CLIENT
                          can demonstrate entitlement to the balance by some other means. FLOOKS reserves the right to
                          request an image of both sides of the debit/credit card used to deposit as supporting evidence
                          in case a deposit comes from a non 3D secure scheme (additional fraud prevention system
                          processing) or if a customer is processing large or multiple transactions. In order to reflect
                          the best security practices, the CLIENT will always be asked to hide the CVV number and wipe
                          out certain card numbers. In small number of cases we might require additional proof of
                          residence or transaction in PDF format.</span></li>
